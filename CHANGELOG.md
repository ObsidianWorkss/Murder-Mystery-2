# Changelog

## 1.0.0-rc.1 — 2026-10-17

First packaged release candidate. Existing access keys and the original loader URL remain supported.

### Release polish

- Version and release channel shown in the menu.
- Settings → Copy support report collects version, capability flags, settings, and counters without player identities, access keys, or shot payloads.
- Optional `loader.lua` reports download, compilation, and startup failures.
- Automated compilation and regression checks using pinned Luau 0.739.
- Reproducible ZIP packaging with per-file SHA-256 hashes and an archive checksum.
- Support guidance, issue template, third-party notices, and a live release checklist.

### Combat and performance

- Conservative gun timing checks, clear-target knife protection, offscreen knife acquisition, and clicked stab assistance.
- Native post-throw stab cooldown and release-time target/weapon checks.
- Fresh attack calculations with cached visual previews and bounded background motion sampling.
- Fewer duplicate timing rays, early rejection of failed conservative checks, and reusable line-of-sight filter storage.

### Known limitations

- Hits, damage, kills, pickup, and fling outcomes remain server-controlled.
- Two existing local-dummy motion probes fail identically in baseline and performance builds. See `tests/VALIDATION.md`.
- This release candidate's new menu/report controls have not been verified live because the Roblox client is disconnected.
- Device/executor compatibility and the full live checklist remain unverified; this is not a stable-release certification.
