# Changelog

## 1.0.0-rc.4 — 2026-10-17

### New

- Movement card: speed boost, jump boost, infinite jump, noclip and fly, with sliders for walk speed, jump power and fly speed. All start off on load, pause while you fling or are invisible, never unfreeze a player the game froze, and switch off with End or Unload.

### Menu

- Tabs follow your role: Murderer (knife aim, kill aura), Sheriff (gun aim), Innocent (knife dodge, gun pickup), then Fling, Movement, Visuals, Players and Settings.
- Aim assist, the master switch, moved to Home.

## 1.0.0-rc.3 — 2026-10-17

### New

- Players → Chat → **Reveal roles** posts `Murderer: @name • Sheriff: @name` to chat. The card previews the exact message, never names you, skips protected players, refuses while you are murderer and waits 4 seconds between messages.

### Interface

- Status card rebuilt: role chip in the role's color, weapon state, one primary line, and a toned last-shot line when not compact. The whole card drags; the "MM2 · drag" label is gone.
- Overlay buttons now outline their edge instead of their letters; Fire is the accented primary, the MOVE bar is a grip, Stop is a quiet red pill.
- Status pill, murderer warning and ESP labels use the menu font, neutral surfaces, and short lowercase details.
- Shorter menu copy throughout; status cards are titled Status.

## 1.0.0-rc.2 — 2026-10-17

Same features and settings as rc.1.

### Menu

- 20 sidebar tabs reduced to 7: Home, Combat, Visuals, Character, Players, Fling and Settings.
- Each former tab is now a collapsible card inside its group; the first card in each tab starts open.
- Search still finds controls inside cards and opens the card that holds the result.

### Performance

- ESP refresh restyles a highlight only when it is new or the player's role changes, instead of rewriting nine properties per player every tick.
- Dropped-gun ESP and the legacy status labels write only values that changed.
- The aim marker no longer hides and re-shows itself every frame, and skips weapon lookups while the marker is off.
- Idle per-frame work is cheaper: knife dodge checks its setting first, the ghost appearance skips cleanup when nothing is applied, and input-mode detection no longer allocates a closure each frame.

## 1.0.0-rc.1 — 2026-10-17

First packaged release candidate. Existing access keys and the original loader URL remain supported.

### Release polish

- Version and release channel shown in the menu.
- Settings → Copy support report collects version, capability flags, settings, and counters without player identities, access keys, or shot payloads.
- Optional `loader.lua` reports download, compilation, and startup failures.
- Automated compilation and regression checks using pinned Luau 0.739.
- Reproducible ZIP packaging with per-file SHA-256 hashes and an archive checksum.
- Support guidance, issue template, third-party notices, and a live release checklist.

### Combat and performance

- Conservative gun timing checks, clear-target knife protection, offscreen knife acquisition, and clicked stab assistance.
- Native post-throw stab cooldown and release-time target/weapon checks.
- Fresh attack calculations with cached visual previews and bounded background motion sampling.
- Fewer duplicate timing rays, early rejection of failed conservative checks, and reusable line-of-sight filter storage.

### Known limitations

- Hits, damage, kills, pickup, and fling outcomes remain server-controlled.
- Two existing local-dummy motion probes fail identically in baseline and performance builds. See `tests/VALIDATION.md`.
- This release candidate's new menu/report controls have not been verified live because the Roblox client is disconnected.
- Device/executor compatibility and the full live checklist remain unverified; this is not a stable-release certification.
